Write a beginner-friendly tutorial on Rust programming that covers:

1. Basic syntax and concepts including:
- Variables and data types
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Functions
- Ownership and borrowing basics
- Simple error handling

2. Include working code examples for each concept that:
- Are self-contained and runnable
- Use clear variable/function names
- Include comments explaining key points
- Start simple and gradually build complexity

3. Structure and style:
- Break down complex concepts into digestible chunks
- Use conversational, encouraging tone
- Explain WHY behind Rust concepts, not just HOW
- Include exercises for hands-on practice
- Add common pitfalls and solutions
- Use analogies where helpful

4. Sample projects:
- Hello world
- Basic calculator
- Number guessing game
- Simple file operations

Focus on practical understanding over theory. Explain each concept like you're teaching a complete beginner. Assume no prior Rust knowledge.

Remember to emphasize Rust's key safety features and common beginner mistakes to avoid.

Include tips for setting up the development environment and useful resources for further learning.
