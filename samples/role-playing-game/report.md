 Here's a tabletop medieval RPG scenario for D&D 5th edition:

Core concept/hook: A group of skilled adventurers have been hired by a powerful wizard, known only as the "White Sage," to investigate rumors of a powerful artifact hidden in a remote, forgotten monastery in the frozen wastelands of the Ice Plains.

Location description: The monastery is located on a small, isolated island in the middle of the vast, frozen lake, surrounded by towering ice cliffs and a thick ice wall. The island is covered in snow and has only one small, frozen dock for access to the lake. The monastery is a sprawling, multi-story building made of ice and snow, with a few broken windows and a crumbling roof. The path to the dock is covered in broken glass and ice, making it treacherous to navigate.

Time period/season: The monastery is located in the dead of winter, with the temperature hovering around -30°F (-34°C). The sky is perpetually overcast, but the day is rarely bright. The snow is deep and hard, and the ice is slippery.

Key NPCs:
- The White Sage: A powerful, wise wizard who hires the adventurers and provides them with a map and a letter of introduction to the monastery's abbot.
- The Abbot: A wise, elderly monk who lives in the monastery and has information on the artifact and its location.
- The Monks: A group of 5-6 monks who live in the monastery and provide food and shelter to the adventurers. They are peaceful, but their silence speaks volumes about the monastery's isolation and potential dangers.
- The Beast of the Ice Plains: A massive, ancient ice dragon that roams the wastelands, known to attack unwary travelers.

Current situation/conflict: The adventurers are given a map of the monastery by the White Sage and a letter of introduction to the abbot. However, the map is incomplete and vague, leaving the adventurers to figure out the best path to reach the artifact. The Beast of the Ice Plains is also rumored to be in the area, making the journey treacherous.
