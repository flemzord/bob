Bob is a Go application that serves as a bridge between user's ideas and AI language models. It is designed to transform prompts into content. Bob is built on top of the Ollama Go application, which is a platform for building and deploying Go applications. The application is built using the Go language and the Go runtime.

To install Bob, you can use the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/sea-monkeys/bob@latest
```

To use Bob, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the application from the source code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sea-monkeys/bob.git
cd bob
go build
sudo mv bob /usr/local/bin/
```

2. Configure Bob's settings:
```bash
go env
```

3. Create a sample prompt file:
```bash
bob --prompt prompt.md --settings .bob --output report.md
```

4. Run Bob with a sample prompt:
```bash
bob --prompt prompt.md --settings .bob --output report.md
```

Bob will read your prompt, send it to Ollama with the specified configuration, and save the LLM's response to the output file.
