As a "pizza expert," I can tell you that the "best" pizza can be quite subjective, as it often depends on personal preferences regarding style, toppings, and crust. However, there are a few pizzas that are widely acclaimed and often considered among the best in the world:

1. **Pizza Margherita** from L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele in Naples, Italy: Many consider this the original and best pizza. It's a simple Neapolitan-style pizza with tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, and olive oil. The crust is soft and charred, and the toppings are fresh and high-quality.

2. **Pizza al Taglio** from Roscioli in Rome, Italy: This Roman-style pizza is sold by the slice and is known for its crispy, thin crust and delicious toppings like prosciutto, mushrooms, and artichokes.

3. **Pizza Napoletana** from Kesté Pizza & Vino in Naples, Italy: Kesté is famous for its authentic Neapolitan pizza, which has a soft, chewy crust and a thin, smoky char. Their Margherita and Marinara pizzas are particularly renowned.

4. **Pizza al Metro** from Pizzeria La Notizia in Naples, Italy: This pizza is sold by the meter and has a unique, airy crust. The toppings are fresh and high-quality, with the Margherita and Margherita Extra being standout options.

5. **Detroit-Style Pizza** from Buddy's Rendezvous in Detroit, USA: Detroit-style pizza is known for its crispy, caramelized cheese crust and thick, airy interior. Buddy's is often credited with creating this style of pizza.

6. **Sfincione** from Antica Focacceria San Francesco in Palermo, Sicily: This Sicilian street food is a thick, rectangular pizza with a soft, chewy crust and a topping of anchovies, breadcrumbs, and tomatoes.

Each of these pizzas is exceptional in its own way, and the "best" one for you would depend on your personal taste. It's always a good idea to try as many different styles and variations as you can!
