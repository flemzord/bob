1. WebAssembly
The capabilities of WebAssembly have grown considerably since
its release in 2017, and so too has its viability of being used in
stable software projects. While this technology was designed to be
a part of the open web platform, its usage is not limited to the
web environment. It is worth noting that while WebAssembly is
still primarily used to develop web applications, this is changing
over time as WASI matures (see Chapter 2).
More specifically, 58% of our respondents indicate this in a multiselect question about the types of applications or services for
which they use WebAssembly. Beyond this, we see a significant
representation of this technology across a wide range of projects.
This indicates that WebAssembly has a lot of potential and can be
beneficial to all developers across a multitude of sectors and not
just those involved in front-end web development.

The wide scope of applications WebAssembly can be used for is
made possible by the many benefits it offers. Faster loading times
(23%) and opportunities to explore new use cases and
technologies (22%) are the most frequently mentioned aspects
that have convinced respondents of this survey to start using
WebAssembly.
We also see that sharing code between projects (20%), the use of
binaries that run anywhere (18%), and the technology being
language agnostic (18%) have relatively high selection rates. The
acknowledgement of these benefits indicates that WebAssembly is
well-recognised not only for its performance-related benefits but
also for the flexibility it brings to software development.

With the flexibility that WebAssembly offers, developers can take
advantage of its features in a multitude of ways. Our data indicate
that 76% of WebAssembly users are developing new applications
with plans to use this technology from the start. A further 64% are
taking advantage of the portability that WebAssembly offers by
porting their existing applications to new platforms. We also see
that 62% are migrating existing applications to new programming
languages on the same platform.

We note that there is a large overlap between the abovementioned methods, with 34% indicating their involvement in all
three across their projects. Some developers may see tremendous
benefits from migrating existing applications to new languages
and porting them to new platforms simultaneously. In such cases,
WebAssembly provides an easy, two-in-one solution that brings
consistency along with all the other benefits that this technology
has to offer.

When migrating existing applications to new languages in
WebAssembly projects, 37% of respondents report observing
performance1
increases in the 21% to 50% range. A further 30%
report that the performance of their applications has increased by
more than 50% as a result of switching languages. This highlights
that a large percentage of developers are already seeing one of
the key benefits of WebAssembly in their projects and sets up a
promising future for the technology. However, we should note a
small group (6%) of developers report experiencing minimal
performance benefits, suggesting that there may still be ways to
go in the pursuit of native speeds.

We asked developers which programming languages or platforms
they use WebAssembly as a compilation target in their projects.
Respondents were asked to select the language that they use the
most as primary and any other languages that they are also using
in this context.

With a selection rate of 45%, JavaScript stands out as the most
popular programming language for WebAssembly projects. This
likely stems from the strongly anchored base of JavaScript in web
development, with it being the most popular language for some
time. Developers may wish to reuse the code they have already
built in JavaScript in WebAssembly projects. However, we should
note that most of its lead over the other languages comes from
the “also using” category, with only 13% indicating primary usage.

On comparing the results of this survey to our broader research2
,
we find that the adoption of most languages aligns well with their
global usage levels across other types of projects. From this point
of view, we see that Python (29%) and Java (29%) are underrepresented in WebAssembly projects. On the other end of the
spectrum, the popularity of Rust in WebAssembly projects (23%)
far exceeds its total usage across all types of projects (10%). 

As is the case with all technologies, developers can face a wide
range of challenges while working with WebAssembly. 83% of the
respondents from this survey report being affected by at least
one of the listed challenges in their projects.
Difficulties with debugging and troubleshooting are mentioned by
19% of respondents, placing it at the top of the list. This highlights
the increased complexity involved in working with WebAssembly,
with many nuances that go beyond code readability. An example
of this can be seen in 29% of respondents indicating that they
have suffered from one of multiple runtime-related issues. These
manifest through either experiencing different performances
(15%) or a lack of consistent developer experiences (15%)
between runtimes.

Only 6% of respondents mention that using WebAssembly does
not provide sufficient benefits when it comes to the performance
of their applications. As noted earlier, With the performance
benefits being very important to the respondents, this indicates
that WebAssembly manages to meet the expectations of most
developers.

The overall sentiment on the future adoption of WebAssembly is
mostly optimistic for both web and non-web environments. With
WebAssembly being web-based first, the sentiment on its future
adoption is higher for the web than for non-web environments.
More specifically, 39% of respondents are very optimistic about
WebAssembly applications running on the web, while only 26%
are for non-web environments.
Around 22% indicate that they are pessimistic about its future
adoption for either web (15%) or non-web environments (15%).
Considering that this includes developers who are already using
WebAssembly, this indicates that some developers are not yet
convinced by what this technology has to offer. However, it is
important to note that it is an evolving technology with many
features yet to come, some of which we will explore in the
following section of this report.

2. WebAssembly System Interface

With all the benefits of WebAssembly, there is a lot of interest in
using this technology beyond the browser. WebAssembly System
Interface (WASI) is a modular system interface for WebAssembly
aims to do precisely that. This is done through a collection of
standardised APIs that do not depend on browsers and are not
required to be compatible with JavaScript. Our data suggest that
34% of WebAssembly users state that they are currently using
WASI in their projects, and a further 34% report planning to adopt
it in the next 12 months.

We asked respondents who are currently using or planning to use
WASI in their projects about their rationale. Our data indicates
that portability and easier deployment are the most important
aspects that attract developers to WASI, each being mentioned by
42% of our respondents. Along with other attributes, these can
help propel the widespread adoption of WebAssembly for those
who want to take advantage of its benefits beyond its use in web
applications.

Just like WebAssembly, WASI APIs are developed as proposals
through a standardised W3C process. We asked respondents who
are currently using or planning to use WASI which features1
they
are looking forward to the most. HTTP (35%) stands out as the
most anticipated feature, with a selection rate of 35%. This is
closely followed by IO/streams (31%) and SQL (30%), along with
key-value store (27%), runtime config (27%), and filesystem (26%)
slightly further down the line.
